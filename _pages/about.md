I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the [PEIPS group](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/nos-equipes/peips-evolution-de-populations-et-systemes-de-particules-en-interaction) (Population Evolution and Interacting Particle Systems) of  CMAP (École polytechnique, CNRS UMR 7641), under the supervision of [Sylvie Méléard](https://sites.google.com/view/sylvie-meleard/accueil) and [Meriem El Karoui](http://www.elkarouilab.fr/). 

Overall I'm interested in the study of the the interplay between different scales of living systems, and how tools arising from probabilistic and deterministic approaches can help bridge the gap between individual and macroscopic dynamics.

In my PhD, I aim to model the growth and emergence of heterogeneity in *E. coli* bacterial populations under antibiotic stress. Under the action of an antibiotic damaging DNA, bacteria change their growth strategy and do not respond homogeneously to the stress. In addition, the effect of the antibiotic is different depending on the speed of bacterial growth which itself depends on the richness of the growth medium. The aim of my thesis is to develop a model accounting, numerically and mathematically, for the emergence of bacterial subpopulations exhibiting different behaviors depending on genotoxic stress and on the nutritional richness of the environment in which they are immersed. To achieve this goal I use **measure-valued stochastic processes** to model **structured population dynamics**. In particular, I study the ergodic properties of such processes.

 Previous to my PhD I developed techniques to predict the probaibilty distribution and noise structure of single-electron electrical measures in DNA-based biosensors in [Prof. Fujii's lab](http://www.microfluidics.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), as member of [LIMMS](https://limmshp.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) in the University of Tokyo.
