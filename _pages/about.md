On April 2024 I will be joining the team of [Tetsuya Kobayashi](https://research.crmind.net/) at the Institute of Industrial Science of The University of Tokyo as Specially Appointed Research (postdoc).

Until February 2024 I was a PhD student in the group [PEIPS](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/en/research/probability/peips) (Population Evolution and Interacting Particle Systems) and [Inria project team MERGE](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/en/research/probability/merge) of [CMAP (École polytechnique, CNRS UMR 7641)](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr), under the supervision of [Sylvie Méléard](https://sites.google.com/view/sylvie-meleard/accueil) and [Meriem El Karoui](http://www.elkarouilab.fr/). Until March 2024 I continued my research as postdoct founded by the [ERC project SINGER](https://www.ip-paris.fr/erc-singer-stochastic-dynamics-single-cells-growth-emergence-and-resistance). 

# Research topics

I'm interested in the interplay between the different scales of living systems, and particularly how tools arising from probabilistic and deterministic approaches can help bridge the gap between individual and macroscopic dynamics.

**Some keywords:**
* Stochastic Individual-Based Models
* Structured Population Dynamics
* Probabilistic analysis of growth-fragmentation equations 
* Single-cell data-driven modelling in microbiology

## Ongoing projects

### Emergence and stability of cell growth under stress: from single cells to populations
<img align="left" width="33%" src="/images/fig_ecoligrowth.png">
In my PhD, I aimed to model the growth and emergence of heterogeneity in *E. coli* bacterial populations under antibiotic stress. You can found my thesis titled [here]('/files/Manuscrit_2depot.pdf').

Under the action of an antibiotic damaging DNA, bacteria change their growth strategy and do not respond homogeneously to the stress. In addition, the effect of the antibiotic is different depending on the speed of bacterial growth which itself depends on the richness of the growth medium. Using **measure-valued stochastic processes** to model **structured population dynamics** I studied the emergence of bacterial subpopulations exhibiting different behaviors depending on genotoxic stress and on the nutritional richness of the environment in which they are immersed.

### Single electron counting statistics for DNA-based biosensors
 Previous to my PhD I developed techniques to predict the probability distribution and noise structure of single-electron electrical measures in DNA-based biosensors in [Prof. Fujii's lab](http://www.microfluidics.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), as member of [LIMMS](https://limmshp.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) in the University of Tokyo.
