I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at [PEIPS](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/en/research/probability/peips) (Population Evolution and Interacting Particle Systems) and [Inria project team MERGE](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/en/research/probability/merge) of CMAP (École polytechnique, CNRS UMR 7641), under the supervision of [Sylvie Méléard](https://sites.google.com/view/sylvie-meleard/accueil) and [Meriem El Karoui](http://www.elkarouilab.fr/), currently founded by the [ERC project SINGER](https://www.ip-paris.fr/erc-singer-stochastic-dynamics-single-cells-growth-emergence-and-resistance). 

Starting at April 2024, I will join the team of [Tetsuya Kobayashi](https://research.crmind.net/) at the Institute of Industrial Science of The University of Tokyo as postdoctoral fellow.

# Research topics

Overall I'm interested in the study of the the interplay between different scales of living systems, and how tools arising from probabilistic and deterministic approaches can help bridge the gap between individual and macroscopic dynamics.

**Keywords:**
* Stochastic Individual-Based Models
* Structured Population Dynamics
* Probabilistic analysis of growth-fragmentation equations 
* Single-cell data-driven modelling in microbiology

## PhD thesis: Emergence and stability of cell growth under stress: from single cells to populations
<img align="left" width="33%" src="/images/fig_ecoligrowth.png">
In my PhD, I aim to model the growth and emergence of heterogeneity in *E. coli* bacterial populations under antibiotic stress. Under the action of an antibiotic damaging DNA, bacteria change their growth strategy and do not respond homogeneously to the stress. In addition, the effect of the antibiotic is different depending on the speed of bacterial growth which itself depends on the richness of the growth medium. The aim of my thesis is to develop a model accounting, numerically and mathematically, for the emergence of bacterial subpopulations exhibiting different behaviors depending on genotoxic stress and on the nutritional richness of the environment in which they are immersed. To achieve this goal I use **measure-valued stochastic processes** to model **structured population dynamics**. In particular, I study the ergodic properties of such processes.

## Single electron counting statistics for DNA-based biosensors
 Previous to my PhD I developed techniques to predict the probability distribution and noise structure of single-electron electrical measures in DNA-based biosensors in [Prof. Fujii's lab](http://www.microfluidics.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), as member of [LIMMS](https://limmshp.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) in the University of Tokyo.
