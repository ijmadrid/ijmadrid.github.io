I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the [PEIPS group](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/nos-equipes/peips-evolution-de-populations-et-systemes-de-particules-en-interaction) (Population Evolution and Interacting Particle Systems) of  CMAP (École polytechnique), under the supervision of [Sylvie Méléard](https://sites.google.com/view/sylvie-meleard/accueil) and [Meriem El Karoui](http://www.elkarouilab.fr/).

I aim to model the growth and emergence of heterogeneity in *E. coli* bacterial populations under antibiotic stress. Under the action of an antibiotic damaging DNA, bacteria change their growth strategy and do not respond homogeneously to the stress. In addition, the effect of the antibiotic is different depending on the speed of bacterial growth which itself depends on the richness of the growth medium. The aim of my thesis is to develop a model accounting, numerically and mathematically, for the emergence of bacterial subpopulations exhibiting different behaviors depending on genotoxic stress and on the nutritional richness of the environment in which they are immersed. To achieve this goal I use **measure-valued stochastic processes** to model **structured population dynamics**.

Overall I'm interested in the study of the dynamics of living systems from a probabilistic approach. Previous to my PhD I developed techniques to predict the probaibilty distribution and noise structure of single-electron electrical measures in DNA-based biosensors in [Prof. Fujii's lab](http://www.microfluidics.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) and as member of [LIMMS](https://limmshp.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) in the University of Tokyo.
